> [...] the European adoption of this useful device is reflected in
> the name we have for it, volvelle, from the Latin volvere meaning
> “to turn.”  The scope of information that volvelles depict is
> huge. Besides astronomy, subjects include: verb conjugations, color
> wheels, metric conversions, fortune-telling, first-aid techniques,
> and local seasonal foods [...]
